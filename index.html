      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I´m Henry, and I´ve discovered the beautiful world of software development. I´ve been studying software development for about a year now, and i´m absolutely loving it. There´s still so much to learn - and that´s exactly what makes it so exciting.</p>
      <p>Former colleagues have described ma as, <i>reliable, easy to work with,</i> and <i>a true team player</i></p>
      <p>My goal as a software developer is to embrace lifelong learning. Staying curious and continously expanding my knowledge keeps me motivated from within. Right now, my short-term goal is to become employed as a software developer.</p>
